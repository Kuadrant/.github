_Kuadrant enables hybrid cloud application developers to securely expose & consume k8s services. Think AuthN/AuthZ, rate limiting, and OAS._

### Context
Kubernetes gives you the framework to architect and develop services but when it comes to successfully exposing them, be it to other services or human users, Kubernetes gives you the building blocks but not an out-of-the-box solution.

Kuadrant aims to deliver a smooth experience to providers and consumers of services when it comes to rate limiting, authentication, authorization, discoverability, versioning, usage contracts, insights, etc.
